Goals
• Python programming skills
• Data manipulation and data visualization
• Machine Learning Introduction
Description:
In this project, students will work with historical stock price data to build a model that predicts 
future stock prices. The dataset includes information such as opening price, closing price, 
volume, and possibly additional relevant financial indicators. The goal is to implement a small 
application that allows the user to choose the analysis to perform.
Dataset
Download and analyze the data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset/data
Choose a market at your convenience.
Steps and Tasks:

1. Data Exploration:
• Load the stock price dataset and examine its structure.
• Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
• Visualize the historical trends in stock prices over time.

2. Data Preprocessing:
• Convert date-related columns to datetime format.
• Calculate daily returns or other relevant financial indicators.
• Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. Feature Selection and engineering:
• Identify the most relevant features for predicting stock prices.
• Calculate the difference between the high value and low value
• Consider and explore technical financial indicators such as moving averages, 
relative strength index (RSI), or Bollinger Bands. (This task is optional. Explore, if 
everything else is working.)

4. Model Selection:
• Choose a regression model suitable for time-series data (e.g., linear regression, 
time series models like ARIMA, or machine learning models like LSTM for deep 
learning).
• Train the model using the training dataset.

5. Model Evaluation:
• Evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset.
• Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error 
(RMSE) to assess the model's accuracy.

6. Prediction and Interpretation:
• Use the trained model to make predictions on future stock prices.
• Interpret the results and analyze the model's ability to capture trends and 
patterns in the stock data.

7. Visualization:
• Create visualizations to illustrate the model's predictions and compare them to 
actual stock prices.
• If it is the case, plot relevant technical indicators and their impact on 
predictions.

Documentation:
Submit on Moodle the Python script. Comment your code and write as comments the 
conclusions of your analysis. It is mandatory to use functions and small menus to allow the 
user to visualise and select the intended option.

Good work
